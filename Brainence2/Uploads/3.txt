Nowadays it's almost impossible to imagine our life without books. I think it's one of the greatest wonders in the world. Many years ago or maybe centuries people valued books as treasure of the human knowledge and experience.

As for me I like to read books in my free time. Books help me to distract from my problems and daily routine and to get into another world. I like the various genres of books. It depends on my mood which book I take to read. Every book gives birth to special inner world in my mind and in my soul. I like to imagine main characters of my favourite book, their cloths and faces and it's always difficult for me to leave the characters of my favourite novel in the end of the book.

As for me, good literature develop imagination, logical thinking, broader one's outlook, makes people more educated and give a chance to develop. One famous writer said that books are our friends. I completely agree with him. It seems to me that books take an important please in our life and they are necessary for everybody.

As for me I have read a lot of different books, but I can't mark out one special book. But there are some which impressed me more. First of all it is Noter Dame de Paris, then Jane Air, Angelica, little prince, detective stories of Conan Doyle, Dracula by Bram Stoker and many others.

I think that reading books helped me to become more educated, helped to learn a lot of interesting things, enreached my vocabulary. As one proverb says "man cannot live on bread alone". Books are the source of knowledge and the means of self-perfection.
